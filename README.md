# D&D Campaign Manager

Local backend for managing persistent **D&D 5e (2014)** campaign state and integrating an LLM-powered narrative workflow with **SillyTavern**.

The project separates narrative generation from world-state management: SillyTavern is responsible for generating the story, while Campaign Manager extracts structured changes from that narrative, validates them, applies them to the campaign state and persists the result in SQLite.

The goal is to maintain a consistent, persistent world across long-running campaigns while supporting operations such as character changes, items, resources, relationships and world events.

---

## Features

* **Persistent campaign state** backed by SQLite.
* **REST API** built with FastAPI.
* **SillyTavern integration** for processing generated narratives.
* **LLM-based world extraction**, converting narrative text into structured operations.
* **Structured world operations** instead of allowing the LLM to directly modify the database.
* **In-memory `WorldState`** for efficient world manipulation.
* **Memory and context retrieval** for supplying relevant campaign information to the LLM.
* **Turn persistence** with operation and world-change metadata.
* **Turn versioning** using `external_turn_id` and `turn_version`.
* **Swipe / regeneration reconciliation**, restoring the previous world snapshot before applying a regenerated turn.
* **Idempotency and conflict detection** for externally identified turns.
* **World snapshots** used to reconcile different versions of the same turn.
* **Database migrations** for controlled schema evolution.
* **Automated tests** covering services, repositories, API behaviour and turn reconciliation.

## Architecture

The application is organized around a layered architecture that separates HTTP handling, domain logic, persistence and LLM interaction.

### Main components

#### `WorldService`

Owns the current in-memory `WorldState` and coordinates the application of structured operations.

The service works against a working copy of the world and persists successful changes to SQLite.

#### `TurnResolutionService`

Coordinates the domain-level resolution of a turn without coupling the core turn flow directly to the HTTP layer.

Its responsibilities include coordinating:

* narrative generation;
* context;
* world extraction;
* operation application;
* turn resolution results.

#### `SillyTavernIntegrationService`

Acts as the integration boundary between SillyTavern and the campaign backend.

It handles:

* incoming player input;
* generated narrative;
* persistent context;
* world extraction;
* turn persistence;
* external turn identifiers;
* turn versions;
* regeneration reconciliation.

#### `LLMWorldExtractor`

Uses an LLM to identify persistent world changes from narrative text.

Instead of letting generated text directly manipulate the database, the LLM produces structured operations that are subsequently parsed, validated and applied by the application.

#### `OperationParser`

Converts the extracted representation into domain operations such as creating or modifying world entities and item instances.

#### `MemorySearchService`

Provides retrieval over the current world state and builds structured representations that can be used as persistent campaign memory.

#### Repositories

Persistence is separated from the domain services through repository classes.

Examples include:

* `CampaignRepository`
* `CharacterRepository`
* `EntityRepository`
* `TurnRepository`
* `WorldSnapshotRepository`

## Turn Processing

A normal SillyTavern turn follows this general flow:

```text
Player action
     │
     ▼
SillyTavern generates narrative
     │
     ▼
POST /integration/turn
     │
     ▼
LLMWorldExtractor
     │
     ▼
Structured operations
     │
     ▼
Operation validation
     │
     ▼
WorldService
     │
     ▼
SQLite persistence
     │
     ▼
TurnRecord
```

The narrative itself is not treated as the source of truth for persistent state.

Instead:

```text
Narrative
    ↓
LLM extraction
    ↓
Structured operations
    ↓
Domain validation
    ↓
WorldState
    ↓
SQLite
```

This makes the LLM an interpreter of the narrative rather than the component directly responsible for database mutations.

---

## Turn Versioning & Regeneration

One of the main consistency problems when integrating with SillyTavern is **response regeneration / swiping**.

For example:

```text
Turn 42
  Version 1
      │
      ├── Player: "I open the chest."
      │
      └── Narrative: "You find an ancient sword."
                │
                ▼
          World changes
          Sword created


User regenerates response


Turn 42
  Version 2
      │
      ├── Same player action
      │
      └── Different narrative
                │
                ▼
          Restore snapshot
                │
                ▼
          Apply version 2
```

Each externally identified turn can therefore have multiple versions:

```text
external_turn_id = "turn-42"

version 1 → superseded
version 2 → superseded
version 3 → active
```

Before applying a new version, the previous active version's world snapshot is restored.

This prevents regenerated narratives from accumulating mutually incompatible world changes.

### Idempotency

If the same `external_turn_id` and version are received again with identical content, the persisted result can be reused instead of applying the turn twice.

If the same identifier/version is received with different content, the integration reports a conflict.

Older versions are also rejected once a newer active version exists.

This provides a clear consistency model for external turn processing.

---

## World Snapshots

Snapshots are used to reconcile different versions of a turn.

A snapshot contains the persistent world tables required to restore campaign state, including:

* entities;
* items;
* item instances;
* resources;
* resource balances;
* relations;
* world events;
* character states.

The snapshot mechanism allows the application to move from:

```text
World before Turn 42
        ↓
Turn 42 / Version 1
        ↓
World after Version 1
```

back to:

```text
World before Turn 42
```

and then apply:

```text
Turn 42 / Version 2
```

This is particularly useful for LLM-driven interfaces where users can regenerate previously generated responses.

---

## Database

The project uses **SQLite** as its persistent storage layer.

The database is created automatically under:

```text
data/campaign.db
```

Schema changes are managed through application migrations rather than relying on manual database modifications.

This keeps the project local and lightweight while still providing explicit schema evolution.

---

## API

The application exposes a REST API through FastAPI.

### Basic

```text
GET /
GET /health
```

### Campaign

```text
PATCH /campaign
PATCH /campaign/session
GET   /campaign/state
PATCH /campaign/active-character
```

### Turns

```text
POST /turn
GET  /turns
```

### Memory

```text
GET /memory/search
GET /memory/context
```

### SillyTavern integration

```text
POST /integration/context
POST /integration/turn
```

### World

```text
GET /world
```

### Export

```text
GET /export
```

Interactive API documentation is available through FastAPI's generated documentation:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs
```

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* Ollama
* A compatible local LLM model
* SillyTavern (for the integration workflow)

The backend itself uses:

* FastAPI
* Uvicorn
* SQLite
* Pydantic

Development and testing tools include:

* pytest
* Ruff
* httpx

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivin04/Campaign-Manager.git
cd Campaign-Manager
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the runtime dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the development/test tools:

```bash
pip install pytest httpx ruff
```

The database will be initialized automatically when the application starts.

---

## Running

### Windows

The repository includes:

```text
start.bat
```

Alternatively, start the server manually:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

The API will be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Health check:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "ok": true
}
```

Interactive API documentation:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs
```

---

## Ollama

The application uses an `OllamaProvider` as the local LLM provider.

Ollama must therefore be running locally with a compatible model available.

The exact model is intentionally not hard-coded into the project documentation so that the backend can be used with different local models depending on available hardware and desired performance.

---

## SillyTavern Integration

The intended workflow is:

```text
SillyTavern
     │
     │ Generate narrative
     ▼
Campaign Manager
     │
     ├── Retrieve persistent context
     │
     ├── Extract world changes
     │
     ├── Validate operations
     │
     ├── Apply changes
     │
     └── Persist turn
     ▼
SQLite
```

Campaign Manager does not replace SillyTavern as the narrative interface.

Instead, it acts as a persistent campaign-state backend.

This separation allows the narrative layer and the world-state layer to evolve independently.

---

## Testing

The project uses `pytest`.

### Standard test suite

The default CI test command excludes tests that require a running local LLM:

```bash
python -m pytest -m "not real_llm"
```

This is the deterministic suite used for continuous integration.

### Real LLM tests

Tests marked `real_llm` require Ollama to be running with a compatible model:

```bash
python -m pytest -m real_llm
```

### Full local suite

When Ollama is configured and available, the complete suite can be run with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The test suite covers the main application layers, including:

* repositories;
* services;
* world operations;
* API endpoints;
* persistence;
* turn processing;
* SillyTavern integration;
* restart/persistence behaviour;
* turn versioning;
* regeneration / snapshot reconciliation;
* failed regeneration rollback;
* idempotency and conflict handling;
* context before and after a persisted turn.

The goal is not only to test individual functions, but also to verify that persistent campaign state remains consistent across different turn versions and application restarts.

---

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs the automated checks on pushes and pull requests targeting `main`.

The CI pipeline currently performs:

```text
pytest (excluding real_llm tests)
        +
Ruff linting
```

The real LLM tests are intentionally excluded from CI because they require a locally running Ollama service and model.

---

## Design Decisions

### Structured operations instead of direct LLM database access

The LLM does not directly modify SQLite.

Instead:

```text
LLM
 ↓
Extracted operation
 ↓
Parser
 ↓
Domain validation
 ↓
WorldService
 ↓
SQLite
```

This creates a controlled boundary between probabilistic LLM output and deterministic application state.

---

### SQLite instead of a server database

SQLite keeps the project:

* local;
* portable;
* easy to install;
* suitable for a single-user campaign manager.

A server database can be introduced later if the project evolves toward a multi-user or hosted architecture.

---

### In-memory WorldState + persistent SQLite

The application keeps the active world in memory for domain operations while using SQLite as persistent storage.

This gives the domain layer a convenient object-oriented representation of the world without making the LLM or business logic dependent on raw SQL queries.

---

### Snapshots for turn reconciliation

Regenerating an LLM response can invalidate state changes produced by the previous response.

Snapshots provide an explicit mechanism to restore the state associated with the previous version before applying the new one.

This makes turn regeneration a state-reconciliation problem rather than simply inserting another turn into the database.

---

### External turn identifiers

SillyTavern and similar clients need a way to identify the same logical turn across regenerated responses.

The combination of:

```text
external_turn_id
turn_version
status
snapshot
```

provides the necessary information to distinguish:

* new turns;
* repeated requests;
* regenerated responses;
* stale versions;
* conflicting payloads.

---

## Runtime model

Campaign Manager currently assumes a single Python process.

The application keeps a shared `WorldState` in memory and uses a
process-local `TurnExecutionLock` to serialize turn execution.

For this reason, the application must currently be run with a single
Uvicorn worker.

Do not start the application with multiple workers, for example:

    uvicorn app:app --workers 4

Multiple Python processes would have independent in-memory world states
and independent execution locks. SQLite would still serialize database
writes, but it would not synchronize those in-memory states.

The supported runtime is therefore:

    uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765

or the provided `start.bat`.

A future multi-process deployment would require an explicit shared-state
or distributed-locking strategy.

## Current Status — Checkpoint

The current checkpoint has the core state-management and integration flow covered by automated tests.

Validated areas include:

* persistent campaign state;
* structured world operations;
* LLM-based extraction;
* context and memory retrieval;
* SQLite persistence;
* REST API;
* SillyTavern integration;
* turn versioning;
* idempotency and conflict detection;
* snapshot-based regeneration reconciliation;
* rollback after failed regeneration;
* persistence across a simulated application restart;
* end-to-end `context → turn → context` behaviour;
* automated CI testing and Ruff linting.

The project is currently focused on **reliable state management and integration correctness** rather than building a complete virtual tabletop or combat engine.

This checkpoint is intended as a stable baseline for the next development pass. If subsequent changes introduce regressions, the state-management, persistence and integration layers can be re-audited from this baseline.

---

## Roadmap

Potential future improvements include:

* richer character state management;
* improved context ranking;
* more advanced memory retrieval;
* expanded D&D mechanics;
* combat support;
* additional LLM providers;
* improved SillyTavern tooling;
* observability and structured logging;
* optional web UI;
* multi-user / hosted deployment.

These features are intentionally outside the current core scope so that persistence and state consistency remain the primary engineering focus.

---

## Why This Project?

Although the project is built around a D&D use case, its underlying problems are broader:

* integrating probabilistic LLM output with deterministic application state;
* designing persistent domain models;
* maintaining consistency across external clients;
* handling retries and idempotency;
* reconciling different versions of the same operation;
* separating domain logic from infrastructure;
* testing stateful workflows.

The project therefore serves as a practical exploration of **LLM application architecture, state management, persistence and API design**.
